Program analyses aim to calculate properties of program executions 
that hold during execution.

Properties come in many flavors 
 - syntactic vs. semantic 
 - invariant vs. temporal
 - ...  

Properties have been put to many uses 
 - internal properties of implementations drive optimization 
 - checking implicit/explicit assertions and contracts within the code
 - checking output specifications
 - ...

A wide variety of analysis techniques have been developed
 - in cost and scalability
 - in the guarantees they provide about properties, e.g., precision
 - flow, path, calling, scheduling sensitivity
 - ...

The power of these techniques, and what distinguishes them from
simply running a program and observing its behavior, is in their
ability to account for uncertainty.
 
There are different kinds of uncertainty
 - data values
 - control decision outcomes
 - sequencing/timing
 - ...

In recent years, there ... 
 - CPS
