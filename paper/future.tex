\section{Open Questions and Future Directions}
\label{sec:future}

Some possible things to discuss:
\begin{enumerate}
\item tools: tools support for prob. data flow analysis is really lacking
\item building a robust and flexible counting tool: that mixes methods, that cancompute prob. estimates with bounds, etc.
\item hybrid approaches: could we identify portions of a state
space that could be analyzed exactly through symex and then fold
that information back into mc/dfa approaches to boost their precision
\item inference: while we don't cover it in this paper, a key feature of
the most recent prob. programming languages is conditioning in the form
of an "observe" statement.  This functions exactly like an "assume" 
statement and could be used to drive backtracking in mc/symex.  Work
would have to be done to renormalize the prob. measures as in existing
approaches.
\item ... add more here ...
\end{enumerate}
