\section{Computing Program Probabilities}
\label{sec:computingprobabilities}

\mycomment{Matt: here we need to cover things like sampling approaches
to estimate probabilities, model counting, hybrid approaches that mix these}

\mycomment{Matt: we should pull the discussion of counting here from
the prob. symbolic execution section}

\mycomment{Matt: it would be good if there was some discussion about
how to handle a given distribution.  For example, how would prob
sym exe handle a call to a function to return a value from N(0,1)
(a normal distribution with mean 1 and standard distrubution 0).
Equivalently how would this be specified as a usage profile.
Is there something better than relying on a person to write this down?
I know there is tons of work published on this, but is there a simple
approach we can describe or that you've used.}
