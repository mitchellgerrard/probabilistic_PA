Motivating stories:
 - Individual-based Agent Modeling in Ecology
   -> Biologists write models (programs) and do experiments on them
      - cheap, but low fidelity
      - can lead to questions that drive field studies
   -> some models are huge and complex
      - drosophilia & dynamic energy budget model
      - 75k C SLOC, parallel and highly optimized
   -> most models begin simple, encoded in high-level languages
      - wood hoopoe foraging
      - NetLogo
   -> they use simulation to explore their models; mimics experimental regime
   ? What if they could ask "what if question" about their models?
     - is the probability that a non-alpha hoopoe forages for new territory
       when less than 1 year old greater than 0.3?
        
 - UAV software
   -> time-triggered ROS architecture
   -> every cycle system reads new sensor values
      - sensed phenomena vary in understood ways (temp, light, position, ...)
      - sensor error gives rise to uncertainty 
        - again in known ways
   -> would like to be able to reason about the long run behavior
   -> they test and test and test and pour over log data
   ? What if they could analyze their code under an environment that
     modeled the variability they expected?
     - is the probability that the actuator output is within [0,4.5] greater
       than 0.999?
