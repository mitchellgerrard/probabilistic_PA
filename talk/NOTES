Develop the following examples:

1) An illustration of an abstract doman and transformers, etc.
   for data flow

2) An illustration of a program as a distribution transformer.
   Try "abs(x)" where x is drawn from N(0,1)

3) An illustration of counting an abstract element and then 
   multiplying by the the bound

4) An illustration of an abstract domain with probability bounds
   attached

5) An illustration showing how easily abstraction can lead to 
   useless overapproximation

6) A probability distribution bound  is not a probability distribution
   -> has consequences for modularizing these analyses

7) A sym. ex. example

8) A fixpoint example
