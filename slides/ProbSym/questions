What does it mean to learn a choice for a data abstraction?
  - non-deterministic choice between neg and pos
  - learn the choice that maximizes/minimizes probability of correctness
  - this places additional constraints on the inputs by determinizing the choice
    -> neg means "x < 0"

Allows abstract interpretation to be strengthened at critical points
to achieve max/min probability of "event"
  - only strengthen when necessary (i.e., when a choice is required)
